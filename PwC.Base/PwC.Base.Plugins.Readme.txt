====Package Overview===========
-------------------------------
Main project for developing Crm plugins. Approach for creating plugins is based on PwC.Plugins.Base framework (nuget package).
Main purpose is to assign multiple developed handlers for each plugin. Handlers are providing some consistent functionality and can be registered in multiple plugins.
For gathering data in handlers we are using services and repositories which can be accessed from factories. See details in code sample in installed PwC.Plugins.Base folder.
This is an extension of PwC.Base nuget functionality.

Project structure:
====================
==Handlers----------
--------------------
Here handlers should be placed for plugins. Handlers should be organised in subnamespaces (folders) based on the entity in plural name form (Accounts, Contacts, etc.).
Each handler should inherit form CrmActionHandlerBase or CrmEntityHandlerBase generic type, depending whether it's handler for entity message or action.

==Plugins----------
-------------------
Here all plugins should be placed. Plugins should be organised in subnamespaces (folders) based on the entity in plural name form (Accounts, Contacts, etc.).
Each plugin should inherit from PluginBase generic type (RegisterHandlers method must be implemented where all handlers for plugin are registered) and implement IPlugin interface.
